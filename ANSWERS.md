- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

        Because it provides a lot of functionality that you wouldn't normally get by using functional component(lifecycle methods)

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

      1) setState set the value of state 

      2) componentDidMount Is invoked immediately after a component is mounted 

      3) componentWillUnmount Is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and dies. 


- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

      Allows you to use stateful logic and non-visual behavior throughout the reusable components


- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

      Helps catch bugs & Is a kind of safety net. Helpful to when other devs read our code.
